# task-board
All of your to-dos in one place

## Description

Module 5 was building out a Kanban board from given code. It's a way to stay organized, with your tasks keeping in local storage. Truly, this was a very challenging project for me, and it was really touch and go. This project taught me a lot about troubleshooting, console logging things to see if it's working or not. Also really reinforced the notion of commenting on my codes so I know what's happening. Also made a case for more psuedocoding, and more preparation before jumping in.

## Usage

You click Add Task and enter in a title, pick a date, and type out a description. The color of the cards coincides with whether the due date is in the future, day of, or day before. You can drag them between the three boards, "to-do" "in-progress" and "done." and then delete them as needed.

## Credits

The mini project had a lot of overlap, but given the way the week played out, the speedrun was paramount in helping me out, as well as help from my network and Kyle really came in clutch with troubleshooting. https://zoom.us/rec/play/BT5_TARcTcYs6PZthDNXUZh_FJHAqi2NDCjmowxTYf3j0ZCctqePbMAQhX1AvxzPhKOBKedocklZ4OnU.QgOGOXhih7PQ-HDd?canPlayFromShare=true&from=share_recording_detail&continueMode=true&componentName=rec-play&originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FU70y3NZUn7Aj227h3Z7FzZUgV2i0ZdU54p8nidYkkU1eymcjJ5x4zbj27WxKbn9I.TlJ9RfiCWpIveoZG
